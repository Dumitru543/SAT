# SAT Solvers - Resolution, DP, DPLL

This repository contains Python implementations of three SAT solving algorithms:

- **Resolution**
- **Davisâ€“Putnam (DP)**
- **Davisâ€“Putnamâ€“Logemannâ€“Loveland (DPLL)**

These algorithms solve SAT (Satisfiability) problems expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
The repository also includes an example set of results from running these solvers.

## ðŸš€ Setup and Usage

To run the SAT solvers on a CNF formula, simply execute the desired solver script.

### Running a Solver:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system.
3. Place your CNF formula as a list of clauses (e.g., `[[1, -2], [2], [-1]]`).
